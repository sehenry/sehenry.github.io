		That's ME! I was born August 1st, 1987. I am originally from Chicago. I attended University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee and graduated with my bachelors in Education. I taught as a K3 teacher for 4 years, and realized teaching was not for me. I am extremely analytical, logical and determined. I am highly artistic and love thinking outside the box. My personality and interests is what lead me straight into the arms of coding. And so, my new journey begins.

		I currently live on the Eastside of Milwaukee with my two fur babies, Koda and Olive. Koda is an Akita, and just turned 1 over the Summer. She doesn't bark, is extremely well trained and doesn't chew up anything! Olive is 9 years old and super affectionate. Her nickname is "Wethead" because she's always drinking out of a dripping faucet. I love them both dearly.
